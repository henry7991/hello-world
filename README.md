# hello-world
The beginning of something... great?
Well, alrighty. I am, at this moment, a 24 year old unemployed guy who has graduated from an English Philology Bachelor's programme. The only good thing to come out of that was that I was able to move to Japan to teach English.
After working there for a year, I understood that - even though I don't specifically mind teaching - it's not something that makes me happy.
Thus, I decided to try and take on some programming, in order to actually be able to move on to somewhere, hopefully into any IT field.
Currently I'm learning the basics of Python, and am thinking about getting into SQA engineering, as I do have communication skills, and I like seeing projects through from the beginning to the end.
If anyone is currently a SQA engineer or in a similar position, and could give advice, it'd be very appreciated.
